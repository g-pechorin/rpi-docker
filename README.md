# rpi-docker

These are some `Dockerfile` scripts I'm using to teach myself [Docker][wwwDocker] and on my [Raspberry Pi3][orgPi3].
I'm trying to string together a *development server* and I'm using a spare Ubuntu box at work for x86 testing.

... or something ... I'll [post blog updates here][pal] and am hoping to have some writing done before the end of October
